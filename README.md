# Belly_Button_Biodiversity
## Overview
Biomanufacturing food company is looking for people who carry a large number of a certain bacterial species. The goal of this dashboard is to sort the most common species of bacteria and then display the results on the webpage. This project focuses on building an interactive dashboard to visualize the bacterial species living in the navel of candidates of a research about meat protein synthesis from human bacteria.

For this project I used:

1. The data, stored in a json file [samples.json](https://github.com/NensiH/Belly_Button_Biodiversity/blob/main/samples.json).
2. The table is built by inserting JavaScript and Plotly into HTML page [charts.js](https://github.com/NensiH/Belly_Button_Biodiversity/blob/main/charts.js).
3. HTML to build the webpage [index.html](https://github.com/NensiH/Belly_Button_Biodiversity/blob/main/index.html).
4. CSS and Bootstrap to style the page
5. Chrome Developer Tools to test the code.
6. GitHub to deploy and showcase the final results [Belly Button Biodiversity Dashboard](https://nensih.github.io/Belly_Button_Biodiversity/).

The final product allows the research volunteers to choose their Test Subject ID from a dropdown menu, which will display the volunteer's demographic information.

   A bar graph shows the top 10 bacterias found within the participant's belly button. Volunteers can hover their cursor over each bar to see which bacterial cultures are most prevalent.

   The Gauge chart shows the amount of times per week, a participant scrubs their belly button.

   Lastly, A bubble chart that displays bacterial cultures per sample. This chart also allows users to see the prevalence of certain bacterial cultures when they hover their cursor over a bubble.
