# Belly_Button_Biodiversity
## Overview
Biomanufacturing food company is looking for people who carry a large number of a certain bacterial species. The goal of this dashboard is to sort the most common species of bacteria and then display the results on the webpage. This project focuses on building an interactive dashboard to visualize the bacterial species living in the navel of candidates of a research about meat protein synthesis from human bacteria.

For this project I used:

1. The data, stored in a json file [samples.json](https://github.com/NensiH/Belly_Button_Biodiversity/blob/main/samples.json).
2. The table is built by inserting JavaScript and Plotly into HTML page [charts.js](https://github.com/NensiH/Belly_Button_Biodiversity/blob/main/charts.js).
3. HTML to build the webpage [index.html](https://github.com/NensiH/Belly_Button_Biodiversity/blob/main/index.html).
4. CSS and Bootstrap to style the page
5. Chrome Developer Tools to test the code.
6. GitHub to deploy and showcase the final results Belly Button Biodiversity Dashboard.
